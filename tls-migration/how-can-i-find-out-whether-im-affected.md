\(Webshop communication to Datatrans\)

* Iâ€™m using software such as Magento or Shopware with third-party manufacturer payment modules.
  &gt; Contact the manufacturer of your payment module.



* Someone else developed my website.
  &gt; Contact your developer.



* I programmed the website myself.
  &gt; Ensure that your server-to-server requests \(such as statements, credit notes and status requests\) support at least TLS 1.2. You can test this on with our new domains.
