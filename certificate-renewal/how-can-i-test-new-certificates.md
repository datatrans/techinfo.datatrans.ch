# How can I test new certificates?

When we change certificates, we provide you with an IP where we serve it in advance. To test it, you need to create a hosts-entry.

| URL | IP |
| :--- | :--- |
| payment.datatrans.biz | - |
| payment.datatrans2.biz | - |
| pay.datatrans.com | - |
| api.datatrans.com | - |

## Sample hosts file

```text
# certificates Datatrans
193.16.220.4      payment.datatrans.biz
```
