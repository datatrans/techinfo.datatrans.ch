Symantec has allegedly mis-issued more than 30'000 certificates. Google plans to stop recognizing the EV status of all certificates issued by Symantec-owned certificate authorities. This effects Datatrans who owns EV certificates for all their customer-endpoints.

The Certificate model we use on websites today is built on trust. We trust a few Certificate Authorities and they trust us when they issue certificates to customers. Because of this betrayel of trust, Google is currently moving forward with little mercy towards Symantec.
